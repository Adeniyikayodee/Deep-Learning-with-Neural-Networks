# Deep-Learning-with Neural Networks


1.) Here's a basic example of creating neural network with one layer in TensorFlow and Google Colab notebook. 

Example- Predicting House Prices (Predict_House_Prices_(1).ipynb)

In this exercise we'll try to build a neural network that predicts the price of a house according to a simple formula.

So, imagine if house pricing was as easy as a house costs 50k + 50k per bedroom, so that a 1 bedroom house costs 100k,
a 2 bedroom house costs 150k etc.

How would you create a neural network that learns this relationship so that
it would predict a 7 bedroom house as costing close to 400k etc.

This is one of the assignments of a TensorFlow course on Coursera.

2.) INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER VISION

Example - Predict 99% accuracy for handwriting datset (MNIST_classifier_to_test_handwriting.ipynb)

In this exercise, we'll do classification using dataset called MNIST which has items of handwriting -- the digits 0 through 9.
MNIST dataset is already present in Keras library. So, we'll upload it from there.

Write an MNIST classifier that trains to 99% accuracy or above, and does it without a fixed number of epochs -- i.e. you should stop training once you reach that level of accuracy.

Some notes:

    It should succeed in less than 10 epochs, so it is okay to change epochs to 10, but nothing larger
    When it reaches 99% or greater it should print out the string "Reached 99% accuracy so cancelling training!"
