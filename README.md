1.) Creating neural network with one layer in TensorFlow and Google Colab notebook.

Example- Predicting House Prices (Predict_House_Prices_(1).ipynb)

In this exercise, i tried to build a neural network that predicts the price of a house according to a simple formula.

So, imagine if house pricing was as easy as a house costs 50k + 50k per bedroom, so that a 1 bedroom house costs 100k, a 2 bedroom house costs 150k etc.

 Created a neural network that learns this relationship so that it would predict a 7 bedroom house as costing close to 400k etc.


2.) INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER VISION (Creating neural network with multiple layers)

Example - Predict 99% accuracy for handwriting datset (MNIST_classifier_to_test_handwriting.ipynb)

In this exercise, classification using dataset called MNIST ahs been done, which has items of handwriting -- the digits 0 through 9. MNIST dataset is already present in Keras library. 

Written MNIST classifier that trains to 99% accuracy or above, and does it without a fixed number of epochs -- i.e. it should stop training once you reach that level of accuracy.
