# Deep-Learning-with-TensorFlow-


Here's a basic example of creating neural network with one layer in TensorFlow and Google Colab.

Example 1- Predicting House Prices

In this exercise we'll try to build a neural network that predicts the price of a house according to a simple formula.

So, imagine if house pricing was as easy as a house costs 50k + 50k per bedroom, so that a 1 bedroom house costs 100k,
a 2 bedroom house costs 150k etc.

How would you create a neural network that learns this relationship so that
it would predict a 7 bedroom house as costing close to 400k etc.
